#  Creating an AWS Tracking Application using Spring Boot and AWS Services

You can develop a fully functioning item tracking application by using AWS Services, for example, Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), Amazon Simple Email Service (SES), DynamoDB, Amazon S3, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk) and Spring Boot APIs. This application uses AWS Java APIs to insert and track data items and Spring Boot APIs to build a model, view and controllers. In addition, this appliation uses both MySQL and DynamoDB to persist data.  To query or persist data from the MySQL table, you can use the Java JDBC API. 

The AWS Tracking application is a secure web application that requires a user to log into the application.
