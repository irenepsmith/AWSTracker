# Creating a Job Posting Site using Amazon Redshift 

You can create a web application that stores and queries data using Amazon Redshift and the Amazon Redshift Java API. To interact with an Amazon Redshift table, you can use a **software.amazon.awssdk.services.redshiftdata.RedshiftDataClient** object, which belongs to the Amazon Redhsift Java V2 API. The application created in this AWS tutorial is a job posting web application that lets an employer, an administrator, or human resources staff alert current employees or the public about an immediate or future job opening within a company. The data is stored in a Redshift table named blog, as shown in this illustation.
