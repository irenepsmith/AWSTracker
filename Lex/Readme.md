# Using Amazon Lex to engage users within a web application

You can create an Amazon Lex bot within a web application to engage your web site visitors. An Amazon Lex bot is functionality that performs on-line chat conversation with users without providing direct contact with a person. For example, the following illustration shows an Amazon Lex bot that engages a user about a hotel room.

## Create an Amazon Lex bot

The first step is to create an Amazon Lex bot by using the AWS Management Console. In this example, the Amazon Lex **BookTrip** example is used.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Lex console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/lex/.

2. On the Bots page, choose **Create**.

3. Choose **BookTrip** blueprint (leave the default bot name **BookTrip**).

4. Choose **Create** (the console shows the **BookTrip** bot). On the Editor tab, review the details of the preconfigured intents (BookCar and BookHotel).

5. Test the bot in the test window. Start the test by typing *I want to book a hotel*. 

**Note**: For more information about the Book Trip example, see [Book Trip](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/ex-book-trip.html).

## Create an Amazon Cognito identity pool

You can use Amazon Cognito to manage permissions for a web application by creating an identity pool. An Amazon Cognito identity pool (federated identities) enables you to create unique identities for your users and federate them with identity providers.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Cognito console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito.

2. Choose **Manage new identity pool**.

3. Choose **Create new identity pool**.

4. Specify a pool name (**examplepool**) and then choose **Enable access to unauthenticated identities**.

5. Choose **Create Pool**.

6. Expand the **Hide Details** section. 

7. Note the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) name specified in the **Role Name** field (you need to provide additional permissions to this role).

8. Choose **Allow**. 

9. Note the Identity pool ID value (this value is specified in the web page).

## Add permissions to the IAM roles

You must provide the IAM role that you noted in the previous section with these permissions: 
+ 	AmazonLexRunBotsOnly
+ 	AmazonPollyReadOnlyAccess
